#### I am primarily interested in quantitative research on questions of political behavior and communication in the United States. Specifically, I work on projects devoted to understanding political extremism, social identity, and the role of the media in American politics. Primarily using R, I focus on methods leveraging text data and other observational data for causal inference.
