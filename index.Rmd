#### I focus on quantitative research on questions of political behavior and communication in the United States. Specifically, I work on projects devoted to understanding political violence, social identity, and race and ethnic politics in the American context. Primarily using R, I focus on methods leveraging text data and novel observational data for causal inference.

####  I also work as a Research Associate with [Collingwood Research](https://www.collingwoodresearch.com/)

#### Please note that I cannot display personal photographs at this time, given IRB stipulations related to my fieldwork with extremist groups.
