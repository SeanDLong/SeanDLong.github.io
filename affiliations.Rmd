#### <i> Center for Social Innovation </i>
#### I am currently working as a graduate student researcher with the [Center for Social Innovation](https://socialinnovation.ucr.edu/), where I am responsible for collecting and analyzing data on voting behavior in the Inland Empire. This involves data wrangling, spatial mapping, and other programming-based skills.
