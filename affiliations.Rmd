#### <i> UC Riverside Gender Lab </i>
#### I am currently working with [Dr. Jennifer Merolla's](https://jennifermerollaphd.wordpress.com/) gender lab, where I work together with a group of scholars dedicated to studying the role of women in the political system and issues facing women candidates.

#### <i> Professional Colleagues </i>
####  Because no scholar works alone, I am also indebted to my colleagues with the [UCR Political Science Department](https://politicalscience.ucr.edu/)

#### This includes my advisor, [Dr. Loren Collingwood](https://www.collingwoodresearch.com/) and my fellow student [Stephanie DeMora](https://www.stephaniedemora.com/)
