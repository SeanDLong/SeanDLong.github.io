#### <i> White Identity, Donald Trump, and the Mobilization of Extremism </i>
#### Forthcoming in Politics, Groups, and Identity
#### This paper seeks to examine the relationship between extremist mobilization and elite cues. Specifi-cally, I explore how political elites can mobilize fringe extremists by looking at a specific examplewhere Trump’s 2016 candidacy mobilized members of the White extremist alt-right by appealing totheir sense of White in-group identification. It will first be shown how the alt-right was responsive toTrump’s rhetoric by performing interrupted time series analyses on blog texts from the prominentextremistDaily Stormer.  Then, I will incorporate results from a survey experiment showing howWhite identity motivates those high in alt-right sentiment to support candidates who use racializedand White identity-related rhetoric. Finally, I connect these observations using data from the 2016ANES pilot to show how White identity uniquely motivated primary-era support for Trump, showinghow Trump was distinct in his appeal to those high in White identity. Across these last three analyses,I also show how out-group animus in the form of racial resentment consistently fails to predict theunique support that Trump received from the alt-right. Overall, this paper shows how White identitycan result in White extremist support for a mainstream political candidate.

#### <i> Can States Promote Minority Representation? Assessing the Effects of the California Voting Rights Act </i>
#### Published by <i> Urban Affairs Review </i> (https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/XHY9PYYKB8FQW2PE6IZ6/full)
#### The passage of the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) sought to broaden representation in largely white-controlled city councils state-wide by incentivizing cities to shift council electoral jurisdictions from at-large to single-member districts.  However, little research has investigated the success orfailure of the CVRA, and legal battles continue over the implementation of the CVRA. This paperemploys causal inference methods (matching and difference-in-difference) to determine if the CVRAhas actually led to city council diversification. By comparing the racial composition of city councilsbefore and after fully switching from at-large to district election jurisdictions, we estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of city switching on minority city council representation at 13-14%. Further analysis reveals treatment effects are larger among cities with larger shares of Latinos (29-32%).Thus, states seeking to increase local-level minority representation should consider policies similar tothose found in the California Voting Rights Act.

#### <i> Demographic Change, White Decline, and the Changing Nature of Racial Politics in Election Campaigns </i>
#### Forthcoming in the <i> Cambridge Handbook of Political Psychology </i>
#### The role that race and racism plays in American elections and politics cannot be understated. As the nation diversifies and moves towards majority-minority status by mid-century, the two major political parties are further polarizing on issues of racial inclusion, racial policy, and racial appeals in electoral campaigns. Each year, the electorate becomes a bit less White, meaning that candidates of color are more likely to run and win, and that White candidates appeal more specifically to various communities of color. This chapter examines the extant literature on race and political psychology, in an effort to highlight the continuing political significance of race and ethnicity given long term demographic change. Additionally, we show that appeals to race and racism continue to play a key role in American democracy.
