#### <i> Emotional Engagement in the Year of the Woman </i>
#### Submitted to American Political Science Review
#### Women, especially Democratic women, have become more deeply engaged in politics since the 2016 election. It is not entirely clear what role, if any, the political environment has played in shaping this increased political engagement, or what mechanisms are underlying it. We argue that gendered features of the political environment from 2016 and beyond influenced emotional reactions to politics, but in distinct ways and more strongly for Democratic women, and these in turn led to increased engagement. We test our arguments using experimental designs in which participants were randomly assigned to read vignettes about Trump’s treatment of women, Clinton’s historic run for office, the Women’s Marches, or the #MeToo movement. We find that reading about Trump’s treatment of women led to higher anger, especially among Democratic women, while reading about Clinton’s run for office instead increased enthusiasm among highly educated women, and these elevated emotions increased intended future engagement.

#### <i> Can States Promote Minority Representation? Assessing the Effects of the California Voting Rights Act </i>
#### Published by <i> Urban Affairs Review </i> (https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/XHY9PYYKB8FQW2PE6IZ6/full)
#### The passage of the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) sought to broaden representation in largely white-controlled city councils state-wide by incentivizing cities to shift council electoral jurisdictions from at-large to single-member districts.  However, little research has investigated the success orfailure of the CVRA, and legal battles continue over the implementation of the CVRA. This paperemploys causal inference methods (matching and difference-in-difference) to determine if the CVRAhas actually led to city council diversification. By comparing the racial composition of city councilsbefore and after fully switching from at-large to district election jurisdictions, we estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of city switching on minority city council representation at 13-14%. Further analysis reveals treatment effects are larger among cities with larger shares of Latinos (29-32%).Thus, states seeking to increase local-level minority representation should consider policies similar tothose found in the California Voting Rights Act.

#### <i> Demographic Change, White Decline, and the Changing Nature of Racial Politics in Election Campaigns </i>
#### Forthcoming in the <i> Cambridge Handbook of Political Psychology </i>
#### The role that race and racism plays in American elections and politics cannot be understated. As the nation diversifies and moves towards majority-minority status by mid-century, the two major political parties are further polarizing on issues of racial inclusion, racial policy, and racial appeals in electoral campaigns. Each year, the electorate becomes a bit less White, meaning that candidates of color are more likely to run and win, and that White candidates appeal more specifically to various communities of color. This chapter examines the extant literature on race and political psychology, in an effort to highlight the continuing political significance of race and ethnicity given long term demographic change. Additionally, we show that appeals to race and racism continue to play a key role in American democracy.
