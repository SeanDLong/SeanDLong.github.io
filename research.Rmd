#### <i> Can States Promote Minority Representation? Assessing the Effects of the California Voting Rights Act </i>
#### Published by <i> Urban Affairs Review </i> (https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/XHY9PYYKB8FQW2PE6IZ6/full)
#### The passage of the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) sought to broaden representation in largely white-controlled city councils state-wide by incentivizing cities to shift council electoral jurisdictions from at-large to single-member districts.  However, little research has investigated the success orfailure of the CVRA, and legal battles continue over the implementation of the CVRA. This paperemploys causal inference methods (matching and difference-in-difference) to determine if the CVRAhas actually led to city council diversification. By comparing the racial composition of city councilsbefore and after fully switching from at-large to district election jurisdictions, we estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of city switching on minority city council representation at 13-14%. Further analysis reveals treatment effects are larger among cities with larger shares of Latinos (29-32%).Thus, states seeking to increase local-level minority representation should consider policies similar tothose found in the California Voting Rights Act.

#### <i> How the 2016 election hardened conservative discourse on immigration </i>
#### Working Paper
#### There has been a recent increase in scholarly attention to the racialization of American public opinion and the role of fragmentation in media studies. This paper seeks to track how Donald Trump's campaign for president in 2015 and 2016 impacted right-wing media discourse over immigration. Specifically, we show that support for Trump by various media outlets consistently accompanied increasingly hostile narratives surrounding immigration. This effect proved to hold across the right-wing spectrum, including both mainstream and extreme news sources. We use a combination of text-based machine learning techniques to develop models of media trends for both extremist and more mainstream conservative news organizations. By collecting thousands of blog posts and news articles from the white supremacist Daily Stormer, and conservative news outlets Breitbart News and Fox News we were able to show that the Trump campaign essentially united previously fragmented media sources around similar anti-immigrant frames.

#### <i> Women and Political Ambition: Running for Us or Running for Me? </i>
#### Working Paper
#### The year 2018 has been dubbed the year of the woman because of the increased number of women not only running for office, but also winning. For the first time in U.S. history, over 100 women are in the U.S. House, with 32 being newly elected. The freshmen class is also among the most diverse in U.S. history. While the national level has received the lion’s share of attention in the media, similar trends have been happening at the state and local level.  What helps to account for this dramatic increase?

#### <i> Emotional Engagement in the Year of the Woman </i>
#### Working Paper
#### Women, especially Democratic women, have become more deeply engaged in politics since the 2016 election. It is not entirely clear what role, if any, the political environment has played in shaping this increased political engagement, or what mechanisms are underlying it. We argue that gendered features of the political environment from 2016 and beyond influenced emotional reactions to politics, but in distinct ways and more strongly for Democratic women, and these in turn led to increased engagement. We test our arguments using experimental designs in which participants were randomly assigned to read vignettes about Trump’s treatment of women, Clinton’s historic run for office, the Women’s Marches, or the #MeToo movement. We find that reading about Trump’s treatment of women led to higher anger, especially among Democratic women, while reading about Clinton’s run for office instead increased enthusiasm among highly educated women, and these elevated emotions increased intended future engagement.
