#### **Areas of Focus**

</center>

#### **Political Violence and White Identity**
#### My primary research and my dissertation are focused on understanding the politics surrounding White violence in the United States. This research looks both at what motivates "mainstream" Whites to endorse forms of political violence, as well as the factors that lead White extremists to commit acts of hate or to participate in forms of electoral politics. I am also interested in understanding how Whites evaluate political parties and the police according to the extent to which these institutions advance perceived White interests.
#### An initial exerpt of my dissertation relating to alt-right mobilization during the 2016 election is [published in Politics, Groups, and Identity](images/whiteextremism.pdf). In addition to dissertation-related research, I am currently studying the impact of White racial cues with [Dr. Charles Crabtree](http://charlescrabtree.com/) and the politics surrounding firearm and militia culture with Drs. [Ashley Jardina](https://sites.duke.edu/ashleyjardina/) and [Loren Collingwood](https://www.collingwoodresearch.com/).

#### **Local Politics and Voting Rights**
#### The passage of the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) sought to broaden representation in largely white-controlled city councils throughout California. Despite being passed in 2001, the CVRA has only recently seen an escalation in meaningful enforcement, and my research has focused on whether the enforcement of this act has been successful. This initial investigation has led me to study larger questions concerning voting rights enforcement, such as looking at how the CVRA disparately impacts different racial minorities and how district creation can shape electoral outcomes.
#### This research has been [published in the journal Urban Affairs](images/cvrapaper.pdf) and overlaps considerably with my work for [Collingwood Research](https://www.collingwoodresearch.com/).
#### 
#### 
#### **Computational Statistics and Data Science**
#### While I am passionate about my substantive interests, much of my academic focus has been on learning methodology and programming skills. Using my experience with R, I have turned towards studying novel methods such as machine learning, text modelling, and geospatial analysis. These efforts help towards the use of novel and open-source datasets which is necessary to answer unconventional questions. For instance, my work studying extremist discourse has made extensive use of text analysis, while my work on the politics surround gun stores involved the creation of a novel dataset of locational data derived from Google Places.
